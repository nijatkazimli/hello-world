# hello-world
The first code I have ever written

I am an enthusiastic potential developer of the future. Who knows maybe one day I will look at this file and get nostalgic. Right now, it is March 2, 2021, and after almost 10 days I have an SAT exam. My biggest goal is studying in Germany and after working and living THERE! I hope I will be able to do so. If you(me) have already done it, I will be appreciating you. GOOD JOB!
